# JavaScript Exception Handling

## Overview  
This project demonstrates how to handle exceptions and errors in JavaScript. It includes use-cases for `try…catch`, `throw`, custom error types, and good patterns for safe error handling.

## Features  
- Basic `try…catch` usage for runtime errors  
- Using `throw` to trigger custom exceptions  
- Creating and using custom Error classes  
- Ensuring clean-up logic with `finally`  
- Illustrative examples (see `index.html`)

## Why It’s Useful  
Error and exception handling is a critical part of writing robust JavaScript code. Without this:
- Unexpected runtime errors can crash your application or lead to unstable behaviour  
- Developers may struggle to debug or trace problems when errors are not handled properly  
- Good error handling leads to better user experiences (e.g., graceful degradation, meaningful error messages)

## Files  
- `index.html` — the main file demonstrating exception handling examples  
- (You may add `.js` modules or supporting files as you expand)  

## Getting Started  
1. Clone or download the repository  
2. Open `index.html` in your browser (or run via a local server)  
3. Observe the console output (press F12 → Console) to see how exceptions are caught and logged  
4. Modify or extend the examples to experiment with custom error scenarios  

## Best Practices & Tips  
- Only catch errors you can actually handle — don’t swallow exceptions silently  
- Use meaningful error messages to help debugging  
- Clean up resources (connections, timers, etc.) in a `finally` block when needed  
- Use custom error classes when you need to differentiate different error types  
- Avoid using exceptions for normal control flow — they should represent truly exceptional conditions  

## Future Enhancements  
- Add more example scenarios (e.g., asynchronous error handling with Promises / `async`-`await`)  
- Integrate unit tests for expected error cases  
- Create a small UI to demonstrate error handling visually (instead of just console logs)  
- Support browser and Node.js environments
